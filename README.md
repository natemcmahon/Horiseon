# Horiseon Website Accessibility Setup and Code Optimization

## Description

Horiseon already has a website for their company setup. However, this website currently doesn't meet accessibility standards and lacks semantic HTML elements. I have made changes to the HTML and CSS code to improve its accessibility for all users and improved the readability and structure by adding semantic HTML elements and minimizing repetitive code. Through this process I learned about HTML structure, CSS selectors and what it means for a website to be accessible.

## Usage

Horiseon's website with my changes can be accessed at the following location:
